This package is based on https://www.nuget.org/packages/FirebaseCoreAdminRevived/, 
But it has improved code organization and so its usage is similar to older nuget. It supports
- Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Firebase Realtime Database (Basic Crud, no Offline or Streaming support)
- Firebase Storage
- Authentication (Generate Custom Token, no user management)
